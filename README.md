# Running the App

In the terminal, run `npm install` from inside this challenge's directory to install all the necessary JavaScript packages (it's the same idea as `bundle install` in Ruby).

Once `npm install` is finished running, run `npm start` to launch the app. Give it a few seconds and it should open up a page for the app in your browser automatically.

# Release 0: Read and Understand this Intro to the Provided Code

In this challenge, you've been provided with some working React code to start with, and you'll be adding a number of new functionality to that code over time. Before we do that, though, let's walk through each part of this code to understand how it all fits together.

In React, different sections of your app are separated into parts called "components". You can think of each component a little bit like a function that takes in some arguments (which are "props" aka "properties" in React) and returns HTML.

## Breaking index.js down

If you look at the `index.js` file, you will see two distinct sections of code. Let's walk through these. For now, we're not going to worry about the `registerServiceWorker();` line, but we'll cover the rest of what's going on.

### Imports

At the top are the `import` declarations we use to import stuff from other files.

#### Importing other files in our project

Let's start with the line that looks like this

```
import App from './App';
```

This is telling Node to `import` some code from a file called `App.js` and put it in a variable called `App`.

In Ruby, when you require a file, you automatically include 100% of the code in the required file. In JavaScript, you have to specify which parts of your code to "export". Some variables or functions will be made available to be included in other files, and some won't. It's a little like the difference between public and private methods in Ruby.

If you look in the `App.js` file, you'll see `export default App;` at the bottom. This line makes the App class available for inclusion in other files like `index.js`. If you added other functions or classes to the `App.js` file but didn't export them, you wouldn't be able to import them to anywhere else in your project.

#### Importing from npm packages

We are importing a few parts of React itself in the line with `import React from 'react';`. That line says to import the project located in the `react` npm package and name it `React` (you can tell it's a package and not a file we wrote because it says `from 'react'` and not `from './react'` because that starting `./` indicates the current folder in our project, and a lack of it indicates a package from npm). It will grab whatever class or function in the react library has been exported with `export default`.

#### Importing styles

You'll also notice we're importing a css file with `import './index.css';`. This simply includes that stylesheet on the page when React renders without requiring that you add a stylesheet link in the HTML file like you usually do.

### Activating React on the Page

After doing all that importing, we have to actually tell React what part of our page to render in. This is what 

```
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

is for. If you look at our `index.html` file in the `public` folder, you'll see a div in the middle that looks like this: `<div id="root"></div>`. When you call `ReactDOM.render`, you have to pass it an HTML element, and React will render a component inside that element on the page.

What this line is saying in total is "grab our `App` component and render it inside an HTML element with an id of `root`".

## Breaking down App.js

If you look in `App.js`, you'll see a similar imports section at the top, and then a class definition starting with `class App extends React.Component`.

### Extends and Inheritance

`extends` is how you use inheritance in JavaScript. `extends React.Component` means this class inherits all the functions and behavior of the `React.Component` class. If this were Ruby it might look something like `App < React::Component`.

### The render function and JSX

The `render` function is the core of every React component. This is where you specify what the component should look like on the page. You'll do this by writing HTML-like syntax called JSX (you can read more about JSX  [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) or [here](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial/jsx)). The JSX in this render function says to generate a div with a class of `page-center-frame` and then render three different copies of the `Counter` component inside it.

## Breaking down Counter.js

Finally, we have our `Counter.js` file, which defines the `Counter` component. The basic structure of this component is a lot like the `App` component except that it renders differently and it has a `constructor` function and a function called `increment` defined.

### The constructor function

The `constructor` function in JavaScript is exactly the same as the `initialize` method in Ruby. It sets up the class when you first create it.

#### super

The `super` function works exactly the same way as `super` in Ruby. Since the constructor for the `React.Component` class does some important basic setup for all React components, we need to call it to get that setup stuff to run in addition to the extra new behavior we're defining here in `Counter`.

#### Setting the state

State is a core concept in React. You set state in a component whenever you need to know specific information to render your component on the page. For example, if you used React to render a form with radio buttons in it, you would most likely store data on which radio button is currently selected in your state object.

In our case, we are rendering a counter that displays how many times you've pressed a button, so the only information we need is the count, which we want to start at zero. As such, this line

```
this.state = {
  count: 0
};
```

ensures that the count starts at zero.

We will cover the `this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)` line in a little bit. Hold tight.

### The increment function

When we click that button, we want the count to go up by one. To make that happen, we need to increase `state.count` by one. Whenever you change state, you MUST do it with the `setState` function (defined for us in the parent `React.Component` class. Using `setState` ensures that whenever your state changes, React will also rerender the entire component to make sure what is shown on the page stays accurate.

In this case, when we call the `increment` function, React will increase `state.count` by one, and then rerender the counter component on the page to show the new count.

### The render function

In `Counter`, our render function is a little more interesting. In addition to rendering some elements, we also have to tell our button what to do when pressed and to make sure the current count is shown in the appropriate place.

This is using [JSX](#the-render-function-and-jsx) just like the `App` component did. Take a look back at the "read more" links in [that section](#the-render-function-and-jsx) if you feel lost.

#### Button behavior

We decide what the button should do by giving it an `onClick` property with a function.

```
<button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
```

This ensures that the `increment` function will get called whenever the button gets clicked, exactly like calling the `on` or `click` functions in jQuery. In jQuery, this same code might look something like this

```
$('button').click(this.increment)
```
or this
```
$('button').on('click', this.increment)
```

Here is where we need to talk about that weird `this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)` line in the `constructor` function. Just like in jQuery, when someone clicks and we call `increment`, the value of `this` is changed. Inside that function, `this` now refers to the click event object, instead of to our component. Since the click event object has no `setState` function defined, the call to `this.setState` isn't going to work.

We need a way to force `this` to still refer to our `Counter` component, even when it is called because of a click event. To do this, we use the `bind` function. `bind` can be called on any function in JavaScript and it will force that function's `this` to *always* refer to whatever you pass as the first argument to `bind`.

When you set `this.increment` to equal `this.increment.bind(this)` in the constructor, what you're doing is forcing that function to always use the `Counter` component as `this`, no matter where it gets called from. This way, when `increment` is called, `this.setState` will call the `setState` function on `Counter`, instead of trying to call `setState` on the click event object.

### Showing the count

None of this would work if we didn't display the count from `this.state` somewhere on the page. We do this on this line

```
<div className="count">{this.state.count}</div>
```

with `{this.state.count}`. The squiggly brackets in JSX act like `<%= %>` in erb. If this were erb, this part might look something like `<%= @state.count %>`.

## Tying it all together

So, when we go to the page for this React app, here is what happens:

1. `index.html` gets rendered, creating a div on the page with an id of `root`
2. `index.js` gets run. The `ReactDOM.render` function finds the div with an id of `root`, and puts the `App` component into it.
3. When the `App` component is used in `ReactDOM.render`, a new instance of the `App` component is created, and then its `render` function is called.
4. Since there are several references to the `Counter` component in the `App` component's `render` function, several instances of the `Counter` component will be created, and each of their `render` functions will be called individually. The result of those calls will be added to the parts of the page where `<Counter />` appears in the `render` function of `App`.
5. When someone clicks on one of the buttons in one of the `Counter` components, that `Counter`s `increment` function will be called, which will increase `state.count` by one and then rerender that component on the page.

And that's React! Read over this description and the code to make sure this all makes sense, and when you feel reasonably comfortable with everything, let's start adding some new stuff.

# Release 1: Add decrement buttons

Your first task is to add some decrement buttons to each counter, so that people can make the counts go down as well as up. When you're done, the page should look like this

![incrementable and decremental buttons](readme_assets/counters_with_decrement_buttons.png)

# Release 2: Props!!

Your second task is to make the counters count in different ways. Make the first `Counter` count up or down by **one** on each click. Make the second count up or down by **two** on each click, and make the third count up or down by **three** after each click.

Since each `Counter` is still going to behave almost exactly the same as the others (except for how much they increment by), we don't want to make three different component files. That would be a lot of duplicated code. Instead, we're going to use React's "props".

If components are kind of like functions, then props are kind of like arguments. You pass props to a component and then use them inside that component. To pass a prop called `myProp` to one of our `Counter`s with a value of `3`, you would write code like this

```
<Counter myProp={3} />
```

You'll need those brackets around your prop values *unless* they are strings. If you wanted `myProp` to equal "Hello", you could write it like this

```
<Counter myProp="Hello" />
```

When you pass props down in this way, they become accessible in the component they are passed to from the `this.props` object. So you would get the value of `myProp` in `Counter` with `this.props.myProp`.

Props and state are pretty similar in React with one major exception. A slightly oversimplified explanation is that state can be changed (like we do in the `increment` function) and props cannot. When you pass something down to a component like `Counter` as a prop, it is impossible for `Counter` to change its value.

So, using props, update the code in `Counter` to and the `increment` and `decrement` functions to increment and decrement by a different amount in each one, based on a prop that is passed down from `App`.

# Release 3: Display the Total

Your next task is to add something to the page that will display the total you get from adding up the values of every single counter. This is going to be harder than it sounds.

The problem you'll face is that there is currently no way for the `App` component to get access to the counts in its children. React does this by design — parents are not supposed to be able to access or change the state of their children.

In order for parents to know about the counts of their children, you'll have to rewrite your components so that all of the counter values are stored in `this.state` of the *parent* component, `App`, instead of the child `Counter` components. Then you'll have to pass down one counter value to each `Counter` as props. This way both parents and children will have access to that count data and it will be possible to calculate a total to display.

This change creates a problem, though: as mentioned above, you can't change props, which means your `increment` and `decrement` functions in `Counter` are no longer able to change the counter values.

What you'll have to do to fix this is you'll have to define some increment and decrement functions in `App` instead of `Counter`. Because the counter values are now stored in the `App` component's `this.state` object, and as such they can be changed by functions written in the `App` component. They are props in the *child* components, and cannot be changed there, but they are *state* in the `App` component, so they *can* be changed there.

Take some time to absorb this, it may seem weird at first. Then work on building some `increment` and `decrement` functions in `App` that can change individual count values in the `App` component's `this.state` object.

Of course, now we will have yet another problem: these new `increment` and `decrement` functions aren't available in `Counter`, but they need to be called when a button in your `Counter` components are clicked. So how do we call them from `Counter` when they are defined in `App`?

The final step to get this all working is you'll need to *pass down your `increment` and `decrement` functions as props, too*.

You may have some trouble figuring out how to handle maintaining the ability to increment each counter by different amounts. Ask for help on this if it gets you too stuck. Also ask for help if any of the other stuff gets you stuck. React is weird at first for just about everybody.

Once all that is setup correctly, you should be able to both increment and decrement your counters like you could before *and* display a running total of all the counter values added together.

## Hints

### Hint 1

The `increment` and `decrement` functions can be written to take arguments if you need them to.

### Hint 2

If you write the `increment` and `decrement` functions to take arguments, you may have to replace `{this.increment}` with "arrow" function syntax like this `{() => this.increment(someArgument)}`. More reading on this syntax [here](http://javascript.info/function-expressions-arrows#arrow-functions) and [here](http://javascript.info/arrow-functions).

Remember that code like `<MyComponent onClick={this.increment} />` is passing a *function* to `onClick`. React will store that function and call it when someone clicks on our button. But code like `<MyComponent onClick={this.increment()} />` (note the parentheses — `this.increment()` instead of `this.increment`) is calling the function *immediately* as soon as we hit that line in `render` and passing *its return value* to `onClick`. This is a very important distinction. You always want to be passing a function, never its return value.

Because of this, if you start needing to pass arguments to `increment` and `decrement` functions, you'll want to keep in mind that `<MyComponent onClick={this.increment(someArgument, someOtherArgument)} />` is calling `increment` and passing its return value to `onClick` — exactly the thing we don't want.

When our function had no arguments, we could avoid calling it by just not putting parentheses after it (i.e. using `onClick={this.increment}` and not `onClick={this.increment()}`). But what do we do if we need to pass arguments? The only way to pass arguments is by, well, *passing* them (i.e. `onClick={this.increment(arg1, arg2)}`. But doing that is going to call the function, which we don't want to do.

This is where the arrow syntax ([link 1](http://javascript.info/function-expressions-arrows#arrow-functions), [link 2](http://javascript.info/arrow-functions)) comes in. Since `<MyComponent onClick={this.increment(arg1, arg2)} />` is going to call our function, we need a way to pass those arguments without doing that. To accomplish this, we can *wrap the function call in another function* with the arrow syntax. It would look something like this `<MyComponent onClick={() => this.increment(someArgument, someOtherArgument)} />`. That `() =>` syntax means that instead of calling the `increment` function with those arguments and passing the return value, you are instead wrapping the code where you call `increment` inside another function. This way, you're still passing a function, and you're still making sure it gets the desired arguments, but you avoid the problem of calling it right away. React can save that function until someone clicks and run it at that time, just like we want.


# Release 4: Use the array `.map` function to display `Counter` components

It's time to get familiar with how to use [the array `.map` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) in React.

Using [the array `.map` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) in React  component rendering is the equivalent of using `.each do` blocks in `.erb` files in Ruby. Where in Ruby, you might write something like this

```
<ul>
	<% @pets.each do |pet| %>
		<li>
			<%= render partial: 'pet_info', locals: { pet: pet } %>
		</li>
	<% end %>
</ul>
```

in React, you can write code like this (note the [arrow function syntax](http://javascript.info/function-expressions-arrows#arrow-functions))

```
<ul>
	{this.state.pets.map((pet) =>
		<li>
			<PetInfo pet={pet} />
		</li>
	)}
</ul>
```

`.map` stands in for `.each`, `(pet) =>` stands in for `do |pet|`, and instead of partials with a `locals` hash, we have a component with props.

You may notice you get an error about setting a `key` prop when writing code like this. Don't worry about that for now, but do look it up later if you find time. You can find some info on it in [the React documentation for mapping lists](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) (it's probably worth checking out this documentation even if you don't deal with the `key` error right now).

For this release, you'll want to use this `.map` functionality with your list of `Counter` components. Instead of several separate `<Counter />` statements in your `render` function, there should be just one, but it should be inside a `.map` call that iterates over the data for your counters. If the data on your counter values isn't already an array, you'll have to convert it to one to make this work.

## Hint:

If you look at [the documentation for the `.map` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), you'll notice that the callback function has three arguments.

Take a look at this syntax they show you (this is copied directly from the documentation page):

```
var new_array = arr.map(function callback(currentValue, index, array) {
    // Return element for new_array
}[, thisArg])
```

See the part that says `function callback(currentValue, index, array)`? That means that the callback function that you pass to `.map` can have up to three arguments. Which means that the part of the example code above that looks like `.map((pet) =>` could be written like this `.map((pet, index) =>` if you wanted to have a variable representing the current index of the array, or like this `.map((pet, index, wholeArray) =>` if you wanted access to both the current index and the entire original array.

For your counters, this means there's a way to have access to both a counter's current value and its index in an array of counter values. You might find this useful for making sure your increment and decrement functions are incrementing the right counter value.


# Release 5: Add some buttons to add and remove counters

With all the above tools and knowledge in place, the last thing I want you to do is to add a way for users to add or remove `Counter`s from the page. You should be able to create new `Counter` components, and you should be able to delete `Counter`s from the existing list.

You'll need to think for this release about what is needed for this. What information do you need to store in your `state`? What functions will you need to have available? Where should these functions be defined and called from?

Think it through, and then start fiddling.

# Release 6: Refactor

Does everything look nice? Make sure you commit your work once everything is working and then see if there are some ways to clean up any messy bits.
